When solving "Tree Questions", recursion is the most useful method.
Here are some notices and steps regarding recursion:
#1 Do not fall into details, trust the defination of your functions!(How many
stacks can your brain contain?) As you believe the defination, the code you write
will automatically prove it (since your logic is as the same).
#2 Determine structures: preOrder or inOrder or postOrder.
#3 Determine what root node should do.
#4 Determine boundary limits and termination by considering "only root node and nullptr" situation.
