All borders should be thought over according to function parameter list when handling "ListNode" questions

Take Q18 as an example:
  We have 2 function parameters, ListNode** head and ListNode* pToBeDeleted. All function parameters should
be considered carefully using the rules below:
  Does the ListNode exist?(Especially for head)
  Does the ListNode->next exist?(Especially for head and tail)
  Does the operating node exist?	
  Is the operating node the first node or the last node?
  And then, Consider the general situations.

=>  
              *head                       x                 pToBeDeleted
         *head == nullptr                                    delete tail
                                                             delete head 
         *head != nullptr                                delete general nodes
 (head->next == nullptr, only head)                     is pToBeDeleted exist?
(head->next != nullptr, not only head)             (nullptr or not existed in the list)
